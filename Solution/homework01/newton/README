/*Purpose:
 This program is using Newton's method to find where the root is.

 *Precondition:
  f is 2-order continuous itself and We can know the derivation of f somehow.
  x0 is close enough to the root.

 *INPUT:
 f is the subjuct of the study.
 df is the derivative of f.
 a is the start point of initial interval.
 b is the end point of initial interval.
 M is the greatest steps the loop is allowed to run.
 x0 is the first point of the series to approach the root
 eps decides how close between f(x) and 0, when program is permitted to exit.
 
 *OUTPUT:
 x is the closest point to root we can get during the finite steps.
 k denotes how many times the loop runs.

 *Postcondition:
 |f(x)| < eps or k = M
