/*Purpose:
 This program is using secant method to find where the root is.

 *Precondition:
  f is 2-order continuous itself.
  x0 and x1 are close to the root of f enough.

 *INPUT:
 f is the subjuct of the study.
 x0 and x1 are ponits near the root which start the recursion.
 M is the greatest steps the loop is allowed to run.
 delta decides how close between x0 and x1 when the program is permitted to exit.
 eps decides how close between f(x) and 0, when program is permitted to exit.
 
 *OUTPUT:
 Xn and Xn-1 denote a interval [Xn, Xn-1] which contains root.
 k denotes how many times the loop runs.

 *Postcondition:
 |f(Xn)| < eps or |Xn - Xn-1| < delta or k = M
