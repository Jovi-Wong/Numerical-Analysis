/*Purpose:
 This program is using bisection method to find out where is the root of certain functions
 
 *Precondition:
 f is continuous in [a,b]
 f(a)*f(b)<0

 *INPUT:
 f is the subject of study.
 a is the start point of initial interval.
 b is the end point of initial interval.
 M is the greatest steps the loop is allowed to run.
 delta decides how narrow the interval is, when program is permitted to exit.
 eps decides how close between f(x) and 0, when program is permitted to exit.

 *OUTPUT:
 c is the midpoint of the final interval.
 h is the length of the final interval.
 k is the times the program runs.

 *Postcondition:
 |f(c)| < eps or |h|<delta or k=M
